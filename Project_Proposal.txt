Project Idea: Very simplistic browser RPG


Pages Provided:
* Login page
* Create new account page
* Main menu page: User can start a new game, load a saved game
* Character creation page: If the user selects a new game, they will be directed to this page
  in order to name their character and have some customizability options
* Load game page: Contains the user’s previous save data (up to 3 saves) and allows them to
  load it.
* Game page: Page where all the gameplay will happen


Timeline:
* 10/23: Login page and create account page created and stylized. Workout the basic storyline
  and objective of the game
* 10/30: Main menu page finished and allow the user to change settings to dynamically update
  the game page
* 11/6: Create the player model that holds a unique player id, name, level, stats, and money
  and make a basic layout for the first town
* 11/13: Create an inventory for the user and allow the user to save/load a game. Start working
  on the layout of the first level
* 11/20: Design the level system and begin adding dialogue. Begin adding in enemies and bosses
* 12/4: Finish the first level and dialogue
* Rest of the time before turned in: Make improvements and minor changes where needed


Goals:
* Have a well designed and easy to use interface
* Create at least one town and level for the player to progress through
* Have NPCs and character dialogue for more interesting gameplay
* Have enemy and boss battles
* Design a level system
* Allow the user to save and load data
* Allow the user to make decisions that will have lasting effects in the game
* Allow NPC dialogue to reference other users that have played the game and their decisions
* Have a clear objective and story that is easy for the user to understand


Extra Goals (if I have time):
* Create more towns and levels
* Add in more intelligent NPC interactions
* Add in sound effects and animations
